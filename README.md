An Android app to calculate and distribute monthly utility bills (electricity, gas, water) costs to the multiple owners of a building. And finally it sends the separated costs to the owners through SMS.

There's an special case which is included in the app - if water pump, stairs lights etc comsumptions are attached to a owner's meter and there's a submeter to calculate those consumptions. User can input the consumed unit of that meter and the submeter. Those building consumption cost will be deduced from that owner's bill and will be distributed to all owners; which will be calculated accroding to the unit tariff plan of Dhaka, Bangladesh. If not needed leave those fields with a zero.
